    A weather app is a software application designed to provide users with real-time and forecasted weather information for a specific location or multiple locations.

<br>

<b>Hourly Forecast:</b> Breaking down the day into hourly segments to show how the weather is expected to change throughout the day.
<br>
<b>Location-based Services:</b> Allowing users to add and save multiple locations, enabling them to check the weather for different places.
<br>
<b>Weather Widgets:</b> Providing widgets for quick access to weather information directly from the home screen of a user's device.
